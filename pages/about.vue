  ##  How I Work  
  ### Collaborating ü§ù
 I love working on great teams with a shared purpose - because we can go further together.  I take a lot of pride in being a great collaborator, by communicating clearly and empowering others to do great work.  
  
  Feeback from colleagues that have meant the most to me are that I'm a great teacher and that they appreciate how I comment code.
  
  ### Process ‚öóÔ∏è
  I think about products, projects, and code in the long-term, with an eye toward making things maintainable and sustainable.  This means a deep appreciation for clarity and simplicity.  

  I believe high quality products come from high quality processes.  Being process-oriented, I'm continually learning and improving.

  ### < Coding /> 
  When developing, I follow the [12-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) and the [principles of DevOps](https://bfreeds.github.io/foss4gna-2018-devops/).  
  
  I believe writing code is just as much about communicating with humans as it is with computers, and emphasize readability and simplicity.  I have a deep appreciation for well-written documentation, code comments, and clean git commits.

  ### Designing üñåÔ∏è
  When designing, I try to anticipate the needs of users, listen closely, and use empathy.  My aesthetic values simplicity and providing users with delightful experiences.  


  If it sounds like I might be someone you'd like to work with, please reach out!

  ## How I Play üèïÔ∏è
  When I'm not working, I'm reading (especially classics and Russian lit), exploring the city and hinterlands by bike and/or train, community organizing, and doing pottery.  

    Some of my favorite books include:  
  - [*The Brothers Karamazov*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov), by Fyodor Dostoeyvski
  - [*Kristin Lavransdatter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Lavransdatter), by Sigrid Undset
  - *Gravity's Rainbow*, by Thomas Pynchon  
  - [*Space and Place:  The Perspective of Experience*](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/space-and-place), by Yi-Fu Tuan
  - [*A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language), by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, & Murray Silverstein
  - [*Thought and Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky#Thinking_and_speech), by Lev Vygotsky  
  

  I also love nature, especially forests with ferns, mosses, rivers, and good rocks.  I'm passionate about mythology, history, geography, and storytelling through all kinds of mediums - data, clay, poetry, visual art, experience design.
