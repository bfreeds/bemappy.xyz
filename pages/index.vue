# Welcome!
I'm Brandyn Friedly, a geographer who does full stack web development and design with a ‚ù§Ô∏è for community and mapping.  

I also teach, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bfreeds.github.io/foss4gna-2018-devops/">speak</a>, and write (portfolio forthcoming on this site-in-progress).

# Get in Touch üëã
I'm currently seeking my next opportunity to work with a team.  

I'm especially interested in projects in journalism, digital humanities, civic technology, or a similar field that creatively applies software for the common good.

If you'd like to discuss working together, or just say "hi", I would love to hear from you.  You can reach me [here](mailto:bfriedly@bemappy.xyz).
